# MOSS Web UI Frontend

> This is the Web UI Frontend for [MOSS](https://github.com/penguineer/moss).


## Development

The Web UI is based on [React](https://reactjs.org/) and requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) > 14.
Debian packages can either be downloaded on the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) website or are available from the backports repository.


### Run with npm

In the project directory, you can run:
```bash
npm start
```

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Run tests

In the project directory, you can run:
```bash
npm test
```

This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Deployment

### Build with npm

In the project directory, you can run:
```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Contributing

PRs are welcome!

If possible, please stick to the following guidelines:
